# 🧩 Sample HTML Landing Page – Custom UI & Vanilla JS

This repository is a **self‑contained code sample** demonstrating my ability to build
a polished, accessible, and responsive landing page with **semantic HTML**, **handcrafted CSS**,
**WCAG compliance**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery.

It was originally built for a coding challenge but has been refined to serve as a professional example
for recruiters and engineering teams to review my front‑end capabilities.

## 📦 What is this project?

This project is a **custom landing page** designed and implemented with:

- 🧱 **Semantic HTML5** using `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>` landmarks
- 🎨 **Custom SCSS** compiled to CSS (BEM‑inspired architecture, no frameworks)
- ⚡ **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactive features (no jQuery)
- 📱 **Responsive design** supporting multiple breakpoints
- ♿ **Accessibility features** including skip links, ARIA labeling, and focus management
- 🛠️ **Gulp pipeline** for build automation and linting

## 📂 What to Look For

- Explore the **`assets/scss`** folder for token‑based SCSS structure and utilities.
- Review **`assets/js`** to see vanilla JavaScript handling accessibility features (e.g., skip links).
- Inspect the HTML markup for **semantic landmarks** and responsive layout patterns.
- Note the **Gulp tasks** for compilation, linting, and production builds.

If you'd like to dive deeper into any piece, I'd be happy to walk you through it.
