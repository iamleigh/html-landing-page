# ðŸ§© Awesome Motive - Developer Applicant Challenge, Part 2

As a member of the development team, backend (PHP, JS, etc) knowledge is a given. However, itâ€™s equally important to have adequate proficiency with frontend development (HTML, CSS, SASS, etc).

## Challenge: Design to Landing Page

### Overview:

Youâ€™ll create a simple landing page (.html is fine) that follows the design provided.

### Specifications:

- Create an HTML landing page from [our Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/xMcM9KKzzdQY6wyA3VIdBh/WPForms---Developer-Build-Test?node-id=0%3A1).
- Use modern markup and styling techniques/methods.
- Please do not use any markup or CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc).
- The featured image should play [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGYPlAgJPw) when the play button is clicked. How you implement that is up to you!
- The page should be fully responsive â€“ so shift and size down elements as you see fit. Weâ€™ll view this in desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
- CSS should be written using SASS and both the source and compiled files should be included. Method of compiling (gulp, grunt, etc) is up to you.
- Please include all development resources (.git files, composer.json, package.json, etc., if/where applicable).
- Use your name in the folder name, etc.

### Notes:
- You can download and use the [prepared asset files](https://a.supportally.com/DB6zBm) (images and icons).
- **Do not rush!** Strive for attention to detail (one of our core values) â€“ weâ€™ll compare the HTML template to the design file provided ðŸ™‚
